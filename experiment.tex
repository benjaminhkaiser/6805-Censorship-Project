\section{Experiments}
The simulations were run with all mining nodes acting on an individual basis. In practice, miners typically operate in mining pools in which miners cooperate to find new blocks and subsequently share the rewards \cite{Rosenfeld}. 

For our base case, we introduce a partition in which there is an equal number of miners on each side. The expected result is that both sides will continued to grow its own chain at a rate proportional to their side's share of hash power.
