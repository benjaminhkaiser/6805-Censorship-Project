\subsection{Expected Results}
Suppose we have client C, a censored miner sitting behind censorship firewall,  client U, an uncensored miner, and block $B_0$, which is the last valid block known by all parties. Now suppose U mines block $B_1$ containing a transaction with a blacklisted keyword. U transmits an inv message about $B_1$. Since C has never seen $B_1$, it requests the full block from U by transmitting a getdata message for $B_1$. U begins transmitting C a block message for $B_1$, but the censorship firewall notices a blacklisted keyword and intervenes.
Regardless as to whether the censorship firewall truncates the transmission of $B_1$ from U to C or simply resets the connection, the end result is that C will never receive $B_1$ but will know of its existence (since it received the inv message about $B_1$).

To better understand what would happen if a node knew about the existence of a block which it could never retrieve, we examined the source code to bitcoind. In Bitcoin, clients learn of new blocks by listening for block header broadcasts. Once it hears of a new block header, the client attempts to download the block. The reference client keeps track of the active chain; however, it will only ever update the active chain once the block header and the full block are both received and validated. According to a comment in the source\footnote{Specifically, line 2668 validation.cpp in bitcoind version 0.14: https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/0.14/src/validation.cpp#L2668}, this logic was introduced to defend against malicious miners trying to obtain a competitive advantage by broadcasting headers but witholding blocks. Therefore, we expect C to continue mining off $B_0$, the previously known block thereby causing a fork.
