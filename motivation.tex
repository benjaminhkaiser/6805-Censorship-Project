\section{Motivation}
Since content monitored through the Great Firewall is subject to keyword filtering, a situation could arise in which banned words captured within a transaction prevent a confirmed block from being propagated within China. As seen with current filtered content, packets containing requests with banned words are dropped. This could lead to a partition in the network in which those outside of the GFW and those within work on different heads of the blockchain. Given the current implementation of the GFW, only network activity over HTTP is monitored and Bitcoin activity is therefore not subject to filtration. Features could at any point be introduced within the GFW that allow for this vulnerability.
