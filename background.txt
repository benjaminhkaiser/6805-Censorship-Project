IP Address Filtering
For well-known sites that China has decided to ban, the GFW will drop all packets associated with a particular IP address. This assures that the GFW’s reach extends to all content produced by a host’s IP, rather than just a few specified domains.

DNS Misdirection (Hijacking)
When requesting a blocked host name, there are cases in which the DNS servers under the GFW will return a different IP address than the one that corresponds to the domain name requested. The Chinese government can effectively replace the content with material that is more favorable to their interests.

Keyword Filtering
If a banned keyword appears in a URL, after a completed TCP handshake, the GFW will send reset packets to both the source and destination, blocking access to the requested content. Even if a keyword is not explicitly in the URL but appears within the HTML response, the content is also denied. In this particular instance, pages often begin to display but are then truncated after the discovery of a keyword.

Current Effects of the Firewall
Due to both propagation delays and delays caused by the GFW, Chinese miners will hear about blocks mined outside of China slower than ones within the country, causing a communication barrier. This also creates an unfair disadvantage to those outside of China since China has majority hash power. This can constrain Bitcoin itself in some ways such as during the controversy surrounding a proposed block size increase. If the size were to increase, Chinese miners would be subject to further delays, potentially jeopardizing profits.
