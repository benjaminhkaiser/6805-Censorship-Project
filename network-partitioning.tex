\section{Network Partitioning} % TODO This needs work
A network partition could be introduced if traffic monitored by a censorship system (such as the GFW) blocks network traffic describing a mined block that contains a banned word.
If this were to happen, the valid block would be visible to the entire world, except the users behind the censorship system. The uncensored users would mine off the head of the blockchain while the censored users would mine off an older block causing a fork.
Depending on the ratio of mining power between the censored and uncensored miners, the two groups may both continue mining on their forked blockchains, despite the fact that one blockchain will be shorter than the others.
