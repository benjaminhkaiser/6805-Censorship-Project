\section{Network Partitioning}
Since traffic monitored by the GFW is subject to keyword filtering, we wondered if a situation could arise in which a banned word within a transaction could prevent a valid block from being propagated within China. This could lead to a partition in the network, causing a fork in the blockchain in which those outside of the GFW and those within it build off of different blocks. Given the current implementation of the GFW, only network activity over HTTP is monitored and Bitcoin activity is therefore not subject to filtration. Features could at any point be introduced within the GFW that allow for this vulnerability.
