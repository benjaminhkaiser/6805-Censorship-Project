The Bitcoin network would be vulnerable to a network partition attack if an Internet censorship system attempted to filter messages embedded on the block chain.
We explored this vulnerability by assessing the current properties of China's Internet censorship system and the mechanisms through which blocks are propagated by miners.
We discuss experiments we designed to simulate the impact of this attack on the Bitcoin network in various configurations with a hypothetical censorship system. For each of these experiments, we used source-code analysis to hypothesize expected results.
%Although we were unable to run the designed simulations,
We experimentally validated that this attack is not currently feasible against China's censorship system since, at time of writing, it ignores Bitcoin messages.
However, if this were to change, that could introduce this vulnerability and allow an attacker to cause a damaging partition in the Bitcoin network.
In our future work, we plan to run the simulations we designed and compare the generated data to our hypothesized results.
%could coerce the Bitcoin network into dropping recently mined blocks and favoring one fork over another.
