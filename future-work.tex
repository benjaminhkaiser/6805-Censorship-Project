\section{Future Work}
Now that weâ€™ve created a reproducible system to run Bitcoin under Shadow, we would like to use this system to conduct some of the experiments we have described.

In this research, we focused exclusively on Bitcoin and the GFW and did not examine any other real-world cryptocurrencies or censorship regimes. Some permutation of these may be currently vulnerable to the attack we described.
