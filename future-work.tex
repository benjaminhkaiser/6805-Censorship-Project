\section{Future Work}
Now that we have created a reproducible system to run Bitcoin under Shadow, we plan to use this system to conduct the experiments we have described. Our source code analysis used to form our expected results leaves us confident that the simulation will behave similarly to what we anticipate. However, by running the real Bitcoin client in this simulation, we will be able to confirm this hypothesis and also examine any potential side effects caused by clients repeatedly requesting blocks from other miners but never receiving the blocks.

In this research, we focused exclusively on Bitcoin and the GFW and did not examine any other real-world cryptocurrencies or censorship regimes. Some permutation of these may be currently vulnerable to the attack we described.
